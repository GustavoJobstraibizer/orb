# ORB :globe_with_meridians:
Your friendly JavaScript language handler for multi language projects.

###What's the advantage?

- No dependecies
- Simple to use
- Identifies and loads automatically the language available based on the user browser language in their first access.
- Saves and restores automatically the language selected by the user even if the page or browser will be closed.
- Works with any html parameters in addition to text contents inside the tags (e.g titles, values, placeholders... whatever).
